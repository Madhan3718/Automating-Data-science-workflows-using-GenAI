## 🚀 Step-by-Step Workflow

### 📊 1. Data Visualization Using Claude AI

Claude AI was used to automatically generate interactive dashboards from uploaded datasets.

**Key Highlights:**
- Supports drag-and-drop CSV upload.
- Generates HTML/CSS dashboards with Chart.js integration.
- Prompts used to:
  - Suggest best visualizations.
  - Create complete dashboards with axes, legends, and color schemes.
  - Improve dashboard aesthetics based on brand/theme.

### 📉 2. Automated Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) using Julius.ai

Julius.ai helped automate the entire EDA process, saving significant manual effort.

**Steps performed:**
- Loaded datasets like Titanic and Housing data.
- Julius performed:
  - Data summary and statistics.
  - Missing value detection and handling.
  - Outlier detection.
  - Visualization creation: histograms, boxplots, heatmaps, etc.
- Generated downloadable HTML EDA reports for sharing with stakeholders.

### 🔧 4. Automated Feature Engineering using Featuretools

To enhance model performance, I applied automated feature engineering using the featuretools library.

**Workflow:**
- Loaded the California Housing dataset.
- Created an EntitySet and applied Deep Feature Synthesis (DFS).
- Generated transformation and aggregation features automatically.
- Used the resulting feature matrix for model training and evaluation.
